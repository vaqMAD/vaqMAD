<!-- About me section -->
## TL;DR: I build things with code. 
For a few years, I worked as a manager in a SaaS startup. I've seen it all: burning deadlines, client calls at weird hours, and the magical mystery of a Wi-Fi printer that refuses to cooperate. It was a ride, but I realized I‚Äôd rather be the one casting the spells ‚Äî building things from the ground up.

That's why I'm here. By day, I‚Äôm a **Python/Django Developer**, by night **Go enthusiast**. Python‚Äôs ‚Äúlet‚Äôs write a clever one-liner‚Äù and Go‚Äôs ‚Äúlet‚Äôs be absurdly explicit about this error.‚Äù It‚Äôs a daily duel between the poet and the paranoid engineer in my head.

Oh, and I firmly believe there are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don't.
