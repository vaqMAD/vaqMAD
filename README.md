# ðŸ‘‹ Hi stranger ! 

Welcome to my profile.
I'm Damian, Junior Backend Developer, from Konin Poland ![Poland](https://img.icons8.com/color/20/poland-circular.png).

## About me : 
 For about two years, I worked as a Customer Service Manager. In the meantime, I developed my programming skills, specializing in Python and technologies such as Django. 
 I am currently focusing on creating a project for my portfolio [TimeMate](https://github.com/vaqMAD/TimeMate)
 
 I am open to new career opportunities in both management and programming. In my free time, I am interested in modern technologies, books, and computer games.
