<!-- About me section -->
## About me :  
For a few years, I worked as a manager in a SaaS startup. I've seen it all: burning deadlines, client calls at weird hours, and the magical mystery of a Wi-Fi printer that refuses to cooperate.
I like to break down and build things with code and believe there are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don't.

Developing programming skills, specializing in Python and Django. 
Currently focusing on creating a project for my portfolio [TimeMate](https://github.com/vaqMAD/TimeMate)

## ðŸŒ± Other Noteworthy Things
* **Open Source Contribution:** Will Open Source save the world ? I don't know ... But I'm proud to have small contribution to the Django ecosystem by identifying and reporting a gap in the official documentation, which led to its improvement ([Ticket #36026](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36026)).
