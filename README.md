# üëã Hello World

[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Space+Mono&pause=1000&color=3A41E4&width=435&lines=Hi+stranger+!;Welcome+to+my+profile;I'm+Damian%2C+Junior+Backend+Developer+;+from+Konin+Poland+)](https://git.io/typing-svg)

<!-- About me section -->
## TL;DR: I build things with code. 
For a few years, I worked as a manager in a SaaS startup. I've seen it all: burning deadlines, client calls at weird hours, and the magical mystery of a Wi-Fi printer that refuses to cooperate. It was fun, but I realized I prefer breaking down and building things myself.

That's why I'm here. I'm a **Python Developer** specializing in **Django**, and I love turning complex problems into clean, efficient code.
Oh, and I firmly believe there are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don't.


Currently focusing on creating a project for my portfolio [TimeMate](https://github.com/vaqMAD/TimeMate)

## üöÄ Main Project: [TimeMate](https://github.com/vaqMAD/TimeMate)

This is my current pride and joy ‚Äì an API-first backend for time tracking. It's my answer to the question "what happens when you get obsessed with time objects in Python?".

**Highlights:**
* **Architecture:** Clean, modular, and built on SOLID principles.
* **Performance:** Intelligent caching with Redis.
* **Reliability:** 99% test coverage. If it breaks, it's a feature. üòâ
* **Security:** UUIDs, database constraints, and custom permissions.
