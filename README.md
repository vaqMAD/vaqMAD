# üëã Hello World

<!-- About me section -->
## TL;DR: I build things with code. 
For a few years, I worked as a manager in a SaaS startup. I've seen it all: burning deadlines, client calls at weird hours, and the magical mystery of a Wi-Fi printer that refuses to cooperate. It was fun, but I realized I prefer breaking down and building things myself.

That's why I'm here. I'm a **Python Developer** specializing in **Django**, and I love turning complex problems into clean, efficient code.
Oh, and I firmly believe there are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don't.

## üöÄ Main Project: [TimeMate](https://github.com/vaqMAD/TimeMate)

Every developer has that one topic that gives them nightmares. For me, it was dealing with datetime. So, I did the most logical thing: I built an entire API-first time tracking backend to finally make peace with it. This project is the result of that journey.
Built from scratch, not a tutorial clone.
**Highlights:**
* **Architecture:** Clean, modular, and built on SOLID principles.
* **Performance:** Intelligent caching with Redis.
* **Reliability:** 99% test coverage. If it breaks, it's a feature. üòâ
* **Security:** UUIDs, database constraints, and custom permissions.

## üå± Side Quests & Achievements

* **Open Source Contribution:** Will Open Source save the world? I don't know... But I Hope so ! I'm proud to have a small contribution to the Django ecosystem by improving the official documentation ([Ticket #36026](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36026)).
* **Real-World Problem Solving:** Created a **Proof of Concept** at my last company to automate a time-consuming process, reducing manual steps from ~80 to 2.
